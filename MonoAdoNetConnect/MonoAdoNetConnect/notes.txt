If you wish to compile the DB2 DLL yourself you can get it here:

To use this example, you need to do the following to determine connection string to use:

Sign on to IBMi command line

Run WRKRDBDIRE command. (Work with Relational Database Directory Entries)

Determine the Entry name for remote location: *LOCAL. This is the connection name
for your local DB2 database. You should also be able to connect to other IBMi systems
if they are listed in this table just by using it's Entry name and a user id as well.
This will be handy for connecting to other IBMi systems from your .Net application code.

Ex: If your *LOCAL database entry is called IBMI001 and you're logged in as QPGMR, then when 
running the .Net program, your DB2 connection string will then be: 
DSN=IBMI001;UID=QPGMR

You can also simply try and it should work:
DSN=*LOCAL;UID=QPGMR

** Note: the only user that works is the current user so jobs must be submitted to 
run under the user ID that has appropriate permissions to the database. In our
example we will pick up the local user info.

Sample usage with MONO CL command
MONO WORKDIR('/MonoOniSamples/MonoAdoNetConnect/MonoAdoNetConnect/bin/Debug')  
     EXEFILE(MonoAdoNetConnect.exe)                            
     ARGS('DSN=*LOCAL;' 'select * from qiws.qcustcdt')     
     DSPSTDOUT(*YES)
