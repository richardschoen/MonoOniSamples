		Email error: An error occurred while attempting to establish an SSL or TLS 
                                                                           
The SSL certificate presented by the server is not trusted by the system for one or more of the following reasons:
1. The server is using a self-signed certificate which cannot be verified. 
2. The local system is missing a Root or Intermediate certificate needed to verify the server's certificate
3. The certificate presented by the server is expired or invalid.          
                                                                           
See https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/blob/master/FAQ.md#InvalidSslCertificate for possible solutions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution to above error.

// Installing certificates to install above issues. Mono doesn't install automatically.
// Note: Each user must install the certificate stores settings before SSL will work.

Download root and intermediate certificate bundles and copy to an IFS location

// Make sure openssl is installed and available in PASE or Qshell. 
// Run following commands to convert the p7b cert files to pem format which mono needs.
// This example assumes you're in the qp2term command line for PASE and your cert files are in /tmp

cd /tmp
mozroots --import --sync
openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -in O365_Root_Certs_20170321.p7b --print-certs -out O365_Root_Certs_20170321.pem
openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -in O365_Intermediate_Certs_20170321.p7b --print-certs -out O365_Intermediate_Certs_20170321.pem

Run following commands to imports certs to the mono certificate store for your user:
**Make sure /opt/mono/bin is in your search path. You can test by typing: cert-sync and see if you get feedback

cd /tmp
cert-sync --user O365_Root_Certs_20170321.pem
cert-sync --user O365_Intermediate_Certs_20170321.pem

// Run following to import most recent CA certificates extracted from Mozilla in PEM format

From a web browser go to https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html and download latest cacert.pem 

Place the cacert.pem file into /tmp on the IFS

Run following commands to imports the certs to the mono certificate store for your user:
**Make sure /opt/mono/bin is in your search path. You can test by typing: cert-sync and see if you get feedback

cd /tmp
cert-sync --user cacert.pem
