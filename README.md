**Mono on IBM i Code Samples**<br>
This repository will be used to publish .Net and IBM i code samples related to running .Net on IBM i.<br>

**Mono on i Library**
If you want to easily call .Net applications on IBM i and integrate into standard job streams such as CL or RPG, download and install this library on your IBM i as well.<br>

If you don't install the MONOI library you will need to call your .Net applications from a PASE QP2TERM command line for testing. The MONO command makes things much easier.<br>
