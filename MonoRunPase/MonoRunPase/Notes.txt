Compiling and building this program solution

1.) The easiest way to build this .Net code for IBMi is to compile locally in Visual Studio

2.) An alternative option is to build the solution from the PASE command line:

Start pase command line terminal:
CALL QP2TERM

Change to the selected app folder:
cd /monoisamples/MonoRunPase

Call the following command line to build the Visual Studio Solution natively on i:
